    <h2>Basic Terminologies</h2>
    <p>Next up, this cybersecurity for beginners tutorial will help you understand some of the terminologies you must be familiar with before learning anything about cybersecurity.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Network:</strong> A network is a connection between two or more computers so that they can communicate with each other. For example:</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Internet is a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Protocols:</strong> The data that is transferred or received cannot follow any path. There are a set of rules that are followed to control the flow of the internet. These rules are called internet protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is an address assigned to all devices that connect to a computer network and uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address looks like this: 168.192.10.3</li>
        <li><strong>MAC Address:</strong> This is a unique identification number that every device has that connects to the internet. Traditional MAC addresses are 12-digit hexadecimal numbers. MAC address looks like this: D8-FC-93-C5-A5-EO.</li>
        <li><strong>Domain Name Server (DNS):</strong> Consider DNS as the phonebook of the internet. All the IP addresses and the name of the links are saved in it. For example, you want to go to google.com. You type this on your web application. Then, this name goes to the DNS server, and the DNS server finds the IP address of google.com. Then, the DNS server returns it to your computer with the IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>DHCP:</strong> Dynamic host configuration protocol is a protocol that assigns an IP address to any device that wants to connect to the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> This is a device that routes the data that comes to it and then sends that data to the destination to ensure that it is on the appropriate path.</li>
        <li><strong>Bots:</strong> Bots are computer programs that control your computer without your knowledge. They automatically send emails, retrieve web pages, and change computer settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Common Cyber Threats</h3>
    <p>Understanding common cyber threats can help in developing strategies to protect against them. Some of the most prevalent threats include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses that can damage or disrupt systems.</li>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Virus:</strong> A computer virus is a malicious code that replicates by copying itself to another program or document and changes how a computer works. The virus requires someone to knowingly or unknowingly spread the infection without the knowledge or permission of a user or system administrator. An example of a virus is the Melissa virus.</li>
            <li><strong>Worms:</strong> These are standalone programs that run independently and infect systems. For example, W32.Alcra.F is a worm that propagates through network share devices.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Distributed Denial of Service</li>
        <p>It is an attack used to restrict a user from accessing the resources by flooding the traffic that is used to access resources. A botnet controller controls all the bots that are under it. The attacker sends a command to the botnet controller that tells all bots to attack a server so that the server will be flooded. When a user wants to access a website, he will not be able to, as the traffic on the website will be at full capacity.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Password Attack:</strong> To crack a password or find a password, we use this technique. There are five types of password attacks:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dictionary attack:</strong> In this method, we handle every password that is possible through the dictionary.</li>
                <li><strong>Brute force:</strong> This is a trial and error method used to decode the password or data. This attack takes the most amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> As the name suggests, a keylogger records all keystrokes on a keyboard. Most hackers use keyloggers to get passwords and account details.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder surfing:</strong> The attackers observe the user’s keyboard by looking over the user’s shoulder.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> A tactic used by cybercriminals to trick users into providing sensitive information by mimicking legitimate communication, such as emails or websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that locks or encrypts data, with the attacker demanding a ransom to restore access to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial-of-Service Attacks:</strong> Attacks that aim to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users, usually by temporarily or indefinitely interrupting or suspending services of a host connected to the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Incidents where information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorization of the system’s owner.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> A type of crime where a thief steals personal, often sensitive, information to assume a person's identity, usually to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits in that person's name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cyber Security Best Practices</h3>
    <p>To protect against cyber threats, it is crucial to adopt security best practices. Some essential practices include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Ensure passwords are long, unique, and use a mix of characters. Consider using a password manager to keep track of multiple passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Keep all software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Antivirus Software:</strong> Install reputable antivirus software to detect and prevent threats from executing on devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Networks:</strong> Use secure Wi-Fi networks and consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when accessing public Wi-Fi.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate Yourself and Others:</strong> Stay informed about the latest cyber security threats and practices. Educating employees and family members about security threats and how to recognize them is equally important.</li>
        <li><strong>Back Up Data:</strong> Regularly back up data and ensure backups are secure and accessible in case of a data loss incident.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Role of Cyber Security Professionals</h3>
    <p>Cyber security professionals work to protect systems and networks. They monitor, detect, investigate, analyze, and respond to security events. They also play a crucial role in creating security policies and educating users about safe practices.</p>
